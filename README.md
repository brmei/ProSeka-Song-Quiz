# Proseka Song Quiz!
<a>ProSeka Song Quiz</a> is a game that allows players to test their song knowledge of Project Sekai. It is modeled after <a href="https://animemusicquiz.com/">AMQ</a>, adding more customization features specifically around ProSeka.

All the code runs locally, but the assets are grabbed directly from other websites. This means this game will not work offline unless the database is updated to reference local files. If anyone wants to do that, feel free. Just update the information in songs.js.

Assets sourced from <a href="https://sekai.best/">Sekai Viewer</a> and <a href="https://projectsekai.fandom.com/wiki/Project_SEKAI_Wiki">Project SEKAI Wiki</a>.

# How to Play
## Game Settings
On the main screen, choose the settings you want to play with! _By default, settings are set for general EN players_. When you are ready, hit the __START__ button to begin the game. More details about each setting can be found under changelog (CTRL+F to find a specific setting).

## Guessing Phase
When a game starts, the program selects a list of songs that fall under the specifications of the settings and shuffles them. If not enough songs are found, the game will alert the player before starting.

Once the songs are selected, they are played one by one for the player to guess them. The game keeps track of which songs are guessed correctly/incorrectly.

In the center of the game screen, an [input box] is provided. Enter the correct name of the song in order to earn a point. Any official variation of the name will be counted as correct. A timer will be counting below it. When the timer reaches 0, the game moves onto the __Reveal Phase__. The player can also press __Skip Phase__ to skip the timer.

## Reveal Phase
The title of the corresponding song will be shown at the top. If correct, it will be <span style="color:green">green</span>. If incorrect, it will be <span style="color:red">red</span>. When the guess is correct, the score counter will increase.

## End Phase
When all the songs have been played, the final score and a corresponding rank is shown. After 5 seconds, the player will return to the main screen.

# Other Features
## Song Control
A volume slider and pause button are included for player control. Use pause button at your own discretion.

## Side Panels
Two side panels are provided for player convenience. The one on the left displays information about the last song and the specific cover played. Song information from Sekai Viewer shown here. The panel on the right keeps track of the songs that the player guessed correctly or incorrectly.
